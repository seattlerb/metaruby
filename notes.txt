1) I've found it best to test the tests first. Stub out the classes
   and make them return crap. Make sure 100% of the tests fail first,
   then work on the code. I've already found a few errors in the
   tests.

2) Rudimentary efforts at getting ruby2c translation shows a big
   problem. Translate.rb automatically skips all standard lib
   classes. We'll need a "no-really" flag.
