This is 'rubicon', a test suite for Ruby and it's libraries.


Warning:
========

This software is pre-alpha. It works on my box, and that's all I
know ;-)  Be warned that you're entering the unknown here.


Prerequisites:
==============

  1. These tests were written for Ruby 1.6 and later.

  2. You'll need RubyUnit installed. You need 0.2.2 as a minimum.
     RubyUnit is available from the RAA, or directly at

         http://homepage1.nifty.com/markey/ruby/rubyunit/rubyunit_e.html

  3. We're slowly getting the tests to run on Windows boxes, but it's
     a struggle. All help gratefully received.


Installation:
=============

  You've done it. Simply untar the files into a convenient directory.
  (If you aren't actually reading this from your copy of the
  distribution, then see "Contacts:", below.)


Structure:
==========

   Eventually, rubicon will test all of Ruby: the core interpreter,
   the libraries, and various add on modules.  For now, though, we
   have tests for the built-in libraries, and some for the language
   features. The tests for the builtins are in the subdirectory
   'builtin', and those for the language are in 'language'. Over time, 
   different directories will be added with additional sets of tests
   (networking, for example).

   In order to run the tests, we need a small amount of support code,
   written in C. This is in the 'util' directory.

Running:
========

   To run all the tests, simply issue:

      make

   at the top level.


   To run all the builtin tests, cd to the 'builtin' directory and
   issue:

      ruby AllBuiltinTests.rb

   To run the tests for a particular builtin class, go to the builtin
   directory and issue:

      ruby Test<classname>.rb

   for example

      ruby TestBignum.rb


   To run an individual test for a particular class, put its name as a 
   parameter

       ruby TestBignum.rb test_OR



Submitting Results to the Rubicon Result Repository
===================================================

    (experimental service)

    http://www.rubygarden.org/triple-r/index.html is a database which
    stores Rubicon results. It welcomes all results, but we're
    particularly interested in Ruby version/architecture combinations
    we don't yet have.

    To submit a result, stay in the top-level directory and do:


       ruby AllTests.rb -op xml | ruby post.rb

    Eventually we'll tidy this up.


Changing:
=========

    Feel free to add tests and strengthen existing ones. I'd
    appreciate context diffs of the changes. All I'd ask is that you
    not add any version of system specific stuff without dropping me a 
    line first: I've got some ideas of how to integrate this cleanly
    which I'd like to talk through with folks.


Environmental Tests:
====================

    Some tests depend on the environment in which they run. Guard
    these with appropriate conditions:

    - if your test depends on the Ruby version, using the Version class 
      methods. Always passing in either a string or a range of strings in 
      the form "1.6.2".   Version is defined in rubicon.rb.

          Version.in("1.6.3".."1.6.6") do
            # stuff that is meant to work in Ruby versions
            # 1.6.3 to 1.6.6
          end

          Version.greater_than("1.6.2") do
            # code that depends on ruby version greater than 1.6.2
          end
      

    - if your test depends on the operating system type, use the
      comparison classes. There's a class defined for each target
      operating system and environment (for example, Linux has one
      class, and Windows has MsWin32, Cygwin, and MinGW). These
      classes define class methods to allow you to include and exclude
      blocks of code depending on the OS that Rubicon is running
      under.

          MsWin32.only do
            # stuff for MsWin only
          end

          Windows.or_variant do
            # all Windows variants
          end

          Linux.dont do
            # don't run this under Linux
          end

      Have a look near the top of rubicon.rb for details.


Contacts:
=========

    Rubicon is available from the Ruby CVS repository:

      $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.ruby-lang.org:/src login
      (Logging in to anonymous@cvs.ruby-lang.org)
      CVS password:  (anonymous)
      $ cvs -z4 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.ruby-lang.org:/src co rubicon
